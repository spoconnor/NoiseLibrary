    // Gradient has the effect of allowing you to specify a line segment in N-dimensional space by
    // setting endpoints.The endpoints are set via setGradient() and the segment extends from
    // P1 = (x1, y1, z1, w1, u1, v1) to P2=(x2,y2,z2,w2,u2,v2). Only the coordinates pertinent to
    // the dimensionality of the function being called are used, however.
    // A gradient field is aligned with this segment such that any input coordinate is projected
    // onto the line formed by the segment, and a value is assigned based on where on the line the
    // projected point lies.If it lies on or beyond P1, the value is assigned as 0. If it lies on or
    // beyond P2 the value is assigned as 1. Anything in between is assigned as a linear interpolation
    // between 0 and 1. (This behavior may be changing; I may remove the clamping aspect, and allow
    // values to go infinitely depending on distance from the "origin" point.Some useful things could
    // be done in this fashion.) The result is a smooth gradient field oriented along an axis.
